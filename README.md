# Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Social network from movie script.
In this project, I created the social network for the characters of the film Pirates of the Caribbean using the script of the movie.   

Inside the __files__ folder you can find an **Ipython notebook** that shows the whole process.  

There is also some statistics about the number of lines/scenes and the dialogues of the characters.

If you want to see all the results, I made a Medium post with them: ##LINK TO MEDIUM##
